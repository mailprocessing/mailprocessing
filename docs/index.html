<p><strong>mailprocessing</strong></p>
<p>The following programs are part of the mailprocessing package:
maildirproc is a program that processes one or several existing mail
boxes in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maildir">maildir</a>
format. It is primarily focused on mail sorting — i.e., moving, copying,
forwarding and deleting mail according to a set of rules. It can be seen
as an alternative to <a href="http://www.procmail.org">procmail</a>, but
instead of being a delivery agent (which wants to be part of the
delivery chain), maildirproc only processes already delivered mail. And
that's a feature, not a bug.</p>
<p>imapproc is a program that processes one or more folders on an <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Message_Access_Protocol">IMAP</a>
server. Much like maildirproc it sorts, e.g. moves, copies and forwards
email. It uses the same filter configuration mechanism as maildirproc: a
Python script that hooks into maildirprocs processing code.</p>
<p>maildirproc was written by Joel Rosdahl &lt;<a
href="mailto:joel@rosdahl.net">joel@rosdahl.net</a>&gt; and is
distributed under the terms of the <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GNU General Public
Licence.</a></p>
<p>imapproc was written by <a href="http://btw23.de/johannes/">Johannes
Grassler</a> &lt;<a
href="mailto:johannes@btw23.de">johannes@btw23.de</a>&gt; and is
distributed under the terms of the <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GNU General Public
Licence</a>, just like maildirproc.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>
<p>So, what's good about using maildirproc instead of a more
conventional setup, with a delivery agent like procmail? For me (the
author) it's this:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's small. maildirproc and imapproc are just small <a
href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> programs that are easy to
understand.</li>
<li>It's robust. If there's a syntax error in the configuration, or a
bug that makes the program crash, then nothing happens; the mail will
not disappear. And as a consequence of using maildirs, no locks are
needed.</li>
<li>The configuration language is relatively easy to understand and use,
yet very powerful. The rules are expressed in a full-blown computer
language (<a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a>).</li>
<li>It's easy to test new configuration. Since maildirproc is not part
of the delivery chain, it's just a matter of taking down or disabling
the process, modifying the configuration and running maildirproc in test
mode. When the new configuration is ready, just start or enable the
process again.</li>

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>For a long time, I used <a
href="http://www.procmail.org">procmail</a> to sort my mail, but I was
not entirely happy with its configuration language. I subscribe to a lot
of mailing lists and I use several e-mail addresses, so the .procmailrc
file was quite large and complex and I found it hard to express mail
sorting rules elegantly. I wanted to be able to define and use
functions, data structures, if statements, loops and other imperative
language constructs and felt that procmail's rule-based vocabulary was
limiting. I thought about writing a program to generate the
configuration from some higher-level rules, but I never got to it. I
also didn't feel comfortable with e-mail sorting being part of the
delivery chain. (Granted, procmail can be used in other setups too.)</p>
<p>Then one day I stumbled upon a program called <a
href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/~jc/maildird.html">Maildird</a>, written
by Jörgen Cederlöf, and I liked its basic design:</p>
<div class="quote">
<p>"Maildird calmly waits until the mail is delivered, notices that a
new mail has arrived in the Maildir it monitors, writes something useful
in the log [...] and moves the mail safely to the correct Maildir."</p>
</div>
<p>Since Maildird was not configurable (at least not at the time) in the
way I wanted, I decided to write my own program that worked somewhat
similarly but with a configuration style that suited me. If you like it,
you are welcome to use (or improve) it too.</p>
<p><strong>Documentation</strong></p>
<p>See the <a href="reference.html">mailprocessing reference</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
<p>See the <a href="examples/">examples</a> directory.</p>
<p><strong>Installation</strong></p>
<p>mailprocessing has no other dependencies than a working <a
href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> on a Unixish system. No special
installation is needed: a simple pip install mailprocessing is
sufficient . You can also run run python setup.py install.</p>
<p>You can run maildirproc or imapproc in several diffent ways,
e.g.:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Manually: You could, for example, run</p>
<div class="code-example">
<p>maildirproc --once -r foo.rc -b . -m Maildir</p>
</div>
<p>to apply the program in foo.rc once on a maildir directory called
Maildir in the current directory.</p></li>
<li><p>By cron: Put a row like</p>
<div class="code-example">
<p>* * * * * maildirproc --once</p>
</div>
<p>in your crontab to run maildirproc each minute (using the default RC
file ~/.maildirproc/default.rc).</p></li>
<li><p>As a long-running process: Just start maildirproc (without the
--once flag).</p></li>
<li><p>Using some service supervision framework, for example <a
href="http://smarden.org/runit/">runit</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
